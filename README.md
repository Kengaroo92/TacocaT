You are currently viewing the GitHub for my **TacocaT Palindrome Coding Challenge**. 

# TacocaT Palindrome Coding Challenge
This is a basic program written in C# that allows the user to input some text into a field. When the submit button is clicked, the program will run and determine if the program is a palindrome. 

The program was written in JavaScript and uses HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap framework for the UI.
